## Quickstarts

PagodaBox allows users to create and submit Quickstarts, which are pre-configured installations of different application frameworks (Wordpress/Magento/Drupal/etc.) that exist to quickly bootstrap an applicaiton. 

It's a great idea but so far the <a href="https://dashboard.pagodabox.com/apps/new?search=symfony" target="_new">Symfony2 quickstarts</a> all include a lot of sourcecode that ties you to a certian version of Symfoyn2. I think providing source is Composer's job, and I'm working on creating a Quickstart that simply installs the newest stable Symfony.
