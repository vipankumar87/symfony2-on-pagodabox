## Composer

- Make sure you have the PHP command line tool available
`$ which php`
- Make sure your version is above 5.3.3 (really the later the better)
`$ php -v`
- Install Composer in your project directory (or globally)
`$ curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php`
- You'll know it worked it if you see **composer.phar**
`$ ls -l | egrep composer`

## composer.json

## composer.lock
