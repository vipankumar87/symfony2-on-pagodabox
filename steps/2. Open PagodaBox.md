## Open up PagodaBox

If you haven't, sign up for PagodaBox, setup your [git SSH key](http://help.pagodabox.com/customer/portal/articles/236852-git-ssh-troubleshooting), (bonus: install [the pagoda client](http://help.pagodabox.com/customer/portal/articles/175474-the-pagoda-terminal-client)), crack open your dashboard [https://dashboard.pagodabox.com/](https://dashboard.pagodabox.com/)… yeah buddy!

## Create a new application in the dashboard
* click New Application
* select Empty Repo
* name your app and click Launch Application
* select Git for deployment mode

When naming you need to pick something globally unique to PagodaBox: just go simple and memorable, it's mainly for your PagodaBox test domain.

After you select Git as your deployment method you'll see instrucitons showing how to get some files into your app.

## Add pagoda remote and then deploy

With our app started in PagodaBox bounce back to local.<br/>
If you haven't committed recently make sure and do so:

```
$ git add . && git commit -m 'Demo content installed'
```
Then run the following commands, changing `fresh.git` to `your-apps-name-on-PagodaBox.git`:

```
$ git remote add pagoda git@git.pagodabox.com:fresh.git
$ git push -u pagoda --all
```
With the remote setup after pushing you'll see a stream of output on your screen like "Building Infrastructure". You're watching your app build and deploy! Once it's done you should see "Decommissioning Previous Infrastructure" and your prompt will return. If your build ends in error, maybe hold tight, we're still configuring things.

## Now git push also deploys

By using the `-u` flag in the last command `pagoda` became the default remote for the current branch (currently master). This means you can just `$ git push` to get changes to PagodaBox. Keep in mind that each time you do this (push master to pagoda) your app will be rebuilt and redeployed — pretty powerful! This behavior can be changed in the Dashboard.

There are other ways to deploy your app but for our purposes `$ git push` will be synonymous with a pagoda deploy. What's cool is that if your build fails your app won't go down. PagodaBox keeps your pervious build running right until your new build completes, so there should be basically zero downtime.

## Boxfile, your production recipe

[ see: [boilerplate/Boxfile](boilerplate/Boxfile) `&&` [About Boxfile.md](About Boxfile.md) ]

PagodaBox uses a file named `Boxfile` that sits at the root of your app and configures your production environment. It's YAML formatted so it's easy to read and edit. Since it's part of your repo it's version controlled, which is awesome because it keeps the state of your code and the state of the production configuration in sync.

```
$ $EDITOR Boxfile
```

```
